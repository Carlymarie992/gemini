## Scenario 2: Ghost Address - Service Defect

### Background
Opposing counsel served motion at 123 Fake Street despite email confirmation of correct address at 456 Real Avenue. Plaintiff never received notice of hearing. Judgment entered by default.

### Step-by-Step Process

#### Step 1: Access Void Judgment Tab

Click on "Void Judgment (Ghost Address)" tab

#### Step 2: Enter Service Evidence

**Service Affidavit Details**:
```
Affidavit of Service filed March 15, 2023 by process server Jane Smith states:

"I, Jane Smith, being duly sworn, state that on March 10, 2023, at 2:15 PM, I personally 
served [Plaintiff] by leaving a copy of the Motion to Modify Custody at 123 Fake Street, 
Apartment 7, Fargo, North Dakota 58102. I knocked on the door multiple times and, 
receiving no answer, left the documents in a secure location per North Dakota law."

Hearing was scheduled for April 5, 2023. No notice sent to correct address. Default 
judgment entered due to plaintiff's non-appearance.
```

**Correct Address Evidence**:
```
Email from opposing counsel dated January 5, 2023:
"Dear Ms. [Plaintiff], Please send all discovery responses to my office at [address]. 
I have updated my records to show your current address as 456 Real Avenue, Apartment 12, 
Fargo, ND 58103. Let me know if this is incorrect."

Plaintiff's response January 6, 2023:
"Yes, that is my correct address. I have lived here since December 2022."

Additional evidence:
- Driver's license updated to 456 Real Avenue on December 15, 2022
- Prior court filings in same case listed 456 Real Avenue (filed February 2023)
- Lease agreement for 456 Real Avenue dated December 1, 2022
- Utility bills in plaintiff's name at 456 Real Avenue since December 2022
- Plaintiff has never lived at 123 Fake Street

Investigation reveals 123 Fake Street, Apartment 7 is:

## Scenario 3: Coercive Control - Delay Justification

Click on "Coercive Control" tab

**Abuse Log**:
```

dismissed with prejudice for lack of evidence.

May 22, 2023: Defendant sent threatening email: "If you try to modify custody, I will make 
sure you regret it. I have friends in the court system and unlimited resources to bury you 
in legal fees. You can't win."

no change in income. Forced plaintiff to respond, costing additional $2,000 in legal fees. 
Motion denied.

motion. When plaintiff attempted to seek enforcement, defendant threatened: "Try it and 
I'll file for full custody."

of parental alienation. Required extensive litigation, expert witness fees ($5,000), and 
attorney time. Motion denied but cost plaintiff $8,000 in defense.

January 2024: Plaintiff unable to afford attorney to file 60(b) motion due to economic 
devastation from defendant's vexatious litigation. Total legal costs from defendant's 
baseless motions: $18,500.

motions" until plaintiff "gives up." Documented pattern of using court as weapon.

litigation system.

Click on "Independent Action" tab

#### Step 2: Document Fraud on Court

**Witness Evidence**:
```
Text message from defendant's mother, Sylvia Langness, dated March 5, 2023:

"John asked me to tell the judge that Jane is on drugs. I know it's not true but he says 
if I don't testify he'll cut me off financially. He showed me what to say. I feel terrible 
about lying but I need the money. He said the court will never know."

Follow-up text dated March 8, 2023:

"I can't do this. I'm going to tell the truth. I can't lie under oath even if John 
threatens me."

Defendant's response dated March 8, 2023:

"If you don't testify like we practiced, you're out of the trust. I mean it. Just say 
what I told you. No one will ever see these texts."

At trial (April 5, 2023), Sylvia Langness testified that she witnessed plaintiff using 
illegal drugs in the presence of the child. Based on this testimony, judge awarded custody 
to defendant.

Post-trial (June 2023), Sylvia Langness provided affidavit recanting her testimony:

"I, Sylvia Langness, state under penalty of perjury that my testimony on April 5, 2023 
was false. I never witnessed Jane Smith using drugs. My son, John Doe, coerced me to 
provide false testimony by threatening to disinherit me. I deeply regret lying to the 
court and want to correct this injustice."
