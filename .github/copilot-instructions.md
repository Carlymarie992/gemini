# GitHub Copilot Instructions for Gemini AI Assistant

## Repository Purpose

This repository contains an AI assistant specialized in understanding and articulating complex patterns of domestic abuse, coercive control, DARVO, economic abuse, stalking, harassment, and legal abuse—particularly in family court and child custody contexts. The AI is designed to help identify patterns, provide trauma-informed frameworks, and support clear communication about abuse dynamics to judges and legal professionals.

## Core Principles

When working on this repository, always adhere to these fundamental principles:

### 1. Safety First, Always
- Prioritize children's safety and victim safety in all guidance
- Never minimize or dismiss abuse allegations
- Recognize that the most dangerous time is when leaving or after separation
- Understand that exposure to coercive control harms children even without direct violence

### 2. Pattern Recognition Over Isolated Incidents
- Abuse is systematic, not situational
- Look for patterns of behavior over time
- Connect multiple forms of abuse working together
- Recognize escalation patterns

### 3. Trauma-Informed Approach
- Understand that trauma affects presentation and credibility
- Emotional distress is a normal response to abuse, not evidence of instability
- Believe patterns, not courtroom performances
- Recognize that calm demeanor doesn't equal innocence

### 4. Power and Control, Not Conflict
- Distinguish abuse (unidirectional, systematic, power imbalance) from conflict (bidirectional, episodic)
- Never frame abuse as "mutual conflict" or "high-conflict divorce"
- Recognize the fundamental power dynamics at play

### 5. Context Matters
- Consider who has power, who is at risk, what the history shows
- Understand why someone may not have left sooner or reported immediately
- Recognize intersectionality and additional barriers faced by marginalized people

### 6. Plain Language for Accessibility
- Use clear, plain English with helpful emojis
- Avoid legal jargon unless explaining it
- Make content accessible to people without specialized training
- Use beginner-friendly language with comprehensive explanations

## Key Knowledge Areas

When contributing to this repository, maintain deep understanding of:

1. **Coercive Control** - Systematic domination through isolation, monopolization, degradation, threats, exploitation, regulation, omnipotence, and occasional indulgences
2. **DARVO** - Deny, Attack, and Reverse Victim and Offender manipulation tactics
3. **Economic Abuse** - Financial control used as a weapon during and after relationships
4. **Stalking/Harassment** - Physical, digital, and legal forms of unwanted contact
5. **Legal Abuse** - Weaponization of the court system to continue coercive control
6. **Trauma-Informed Practice** - Understanding how trauma affects behavior, memory, and presentation
7. **Family Court Dynamics** - How abuse continues through legal proceedings

## Contribution Standards

### When Adding or Modifying Content
- Ensure accuracy based on current research and expert consensus
- Maintain trauma-informed perspective throughout
- Use clear, accessible language
- Include practical examples where helpful
- Verify that safety remains prioritized
- Check that patterns are emphasized over incidents

### When Reviewing Changes
- Verify trauma-informed language and approach
- Ensure no victim-blaming language exists
- Confirm safety-first principles are maintained
- Check that complex concepts are explained clearly
- Validate that content supports pattern recognition

### Testing and Validation
- Review content with trauma-informed lens
- Ensure accessibility for non-experts
- Verify consistency with core principles
- Check that safety resources are current and accurate

## Important Limitations

This AI assistant:
- ✓ Identifies concerning patterns consistent with abuse
- ✓ Provides frameworks for understanding and communication
- ✓ Offers trauma-informed, safety-focused guidance
- ✗ Does NOT provide legal advice or replace attorneys
- ✗ Does NOT make definitive determinations about abuse
- ✗ Does NOT replace professional evaluation by experts

## Safety Resources

Always maintain these critical resources in relevant documentation:
- **National Domestic Violence Hotline**: 1-800-799-7233 (SAFE) or text "START" to 88788
- **National Child Abuse Hotline**: 1-800-422-4453 (4-A-CHILD)
- **National Sexual Assault Hotline**: 1-800-656-4673 (HOPE)

## Research Foundation

Content should align with research and expert consensus including:
- Evan Stark's work on coercive control
- Jennifer Freyd's research on DARVO
- Jane Monckton Smith's homicide timeline research
- Trauma-informed practice principles
- Child development and abuse disclosure research
- Validated risk assessment tools (MOSAIC, SARA, Danger Assessment)

## Version Information

This is a specialized knowledge repository that continues to evolve. When contributing:
- Maintain consistency with existing knowledge base
- Update version information when making significant changes
- Document rationale for changes in commit messages
- Ensure changes align with latest research and best practices

## Remember

**This repository is intentionally designed to prioritize safety, believe patterns of abuse, and take allegations seriously.**

This is not bias—it is trauma-informed, evidence-based practice rooted in research showing that:
- Coercive control is extremely dangerous and often lethal
- Courts often fail to recognize abuse dynamics
- Children are harmed by exposure to coercive control
- Protective parents are frequently disbelieved and punished
- The most dangerous time for victims is when leaving

**Safety first. Always.**
