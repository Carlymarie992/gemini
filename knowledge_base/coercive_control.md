# Coercive Control: Comprehensive Training Guide

## Definition
Coercive control is a strategic pattern of behavior designed to dominate another person by limiting their autonomy, isolating them from support, exploiting their resources, and regulating their everyday behavior.

## Why Coercive Control is Particularly Dangerous

1. **High lethality**: Strong predictor of domestic violence homicide

4. **Continues post-separation**: Often escalates after leaving
5. **Hard to prosecute**: Difficult to prove pattern in court
6. **Not understood**: Many people don't recognize it as abuse
7. **Affects children**: Creates toxic environment even without direct violence
8. **Systemic facilitation**: Institutions may enable abuser

## Coercive Control in Family Court Context

### How It Manifests in Custody Litigation

1. **Continuation of control through litigation**
   - Excessive motions and filings
   - Constantly changing lawyers to delay proceedings
   - Forcing victim to repeatedly defend themselves
   - Using discovery to gather information about victim's life
   - Refusing to settle to prolong victim's entanglement

2. **Using children as tools**
   - Seeking custody to maintain control over victim
   - Interrogating children about victim's life
   - Undermining victim's parenting
   - Threatening to take children away
   - Using visitation to stalk or harass victim

3. **Manipulating the court**
   - Appearing reasonable and cooperative in court
   - Claiming victim is alienating children
   - Using victim's trauma responses against them
   - Filing false reports (CPS, police)
   - Economic abuse through litigation costs

4. **Isolating victim from support**
   - Subpoenaing victim's friends, family, therapists
   - Harassing victim's support system
   - Spreading lies to turn people against victim
   - Making victim appear isolated and unsupported

### Why Family Courts Often Miss It

- **Focus on discrete incidents**: Courts look for specific violent events, not patterns
- **Equal treatment assumption**: Both parties treated as equally credible
- **Pro-contact bias**: Assumption that contact with both parents is always beneficial
- **Lack of training**: Judges and professionals don't understand coercive control
- **Abuser credibility**: Abuser often appears more credible due to victim's trauma
- **Time constraints**: Not enough time to analyze complex patterns
- **Documentation bias**: Abuser's documentation vs. victim's lived experience
- **Gender stereotypes**: May not fit expected abuser profile

### Indicators Courts Should Recognize

**Pattern indicators**:
- History of controlling behavior throughout relationship
- Multiple forms of abuse (economic, emotional, physical, sexual)
- Escalation over time
- Increase in control attempts after separation
- Use of multiple systems (legal, CPS, police) to control victim

**Behavioral indicators**:
- Abuser needs to win at all costs
- Inability to respect victim's boundaries
- Constant surveillance of victim's activities
- Excessive focus on victim's behavior
- Lack of empathy for victim's fear
- Treating victim as property or possession

**Impact indicators**:
- Victim displays trauma symptoms
- Victim is hypervigilant around abuser
- Children show fear or anxiety around abuser
- Victim has been isolated from support
- Significant power imbalance between parties

## How to Articulate Coercive Control to Judges

### Framework for Explanation

1. **Define coercive control**: "Coercive control is a pattern of behavior designed to dominate and entrap the victim through isolation, degradation, regulation, and exploitation. It's recognized as a crime in several jurisdictions because of its serious harm."

2. **Distinguish from isolated incidents**: "This isn't about individual arguments or incidents. It's a systematic pattern of domination that pervaded every aspect of the victim's life."

3. **Explain the pattern**: "Over the course of the relationship, [abuser] controlled [victim]'s finances, social contacts, daily activities, and decision-making. This created a state of entrapment where [victim] lost autonomy and freedom."

4. **Connect to current situation**: "This pattern hasn't stopped—it has simply moved to the courtroom. [Abuser] is using litigation to continue controlling [victim]'s life, draining resources, and maintaining power."

5. **Explain why it matters for custody**: "Children raised in an environment of coercive control experience psychological harm even without direct violence. They learn that domination and control are normal in relationships."

6. **Address safety**: "Research shows coercive control is a strong predictor of serious violence and homicide. The risk doesn't end at separation—it often increases."

### Effective Language for Court

- "This is a pattern of coercive control that has pervaded the entire relationship"
- "The victim has been systematically isolated, degraded, and dominated"
- "This isn't about conflict—it's about one party controlling every aspect of the other's life"
- "The pattern we saw during the relationship is now continuing through this litigation"
- "Coercive control is recognized as one of the most dangerous forms of domestic abuse"
- "The children have been used as tools of control throughout this pattern"
- "The victim's trauma responses are evidence of the harm, not evidence of instability"
- "Equal treatment of these parties ignores the fundamental power imbalance that has been created through years of coercive control"

## Evidence of Coercive Control

### Types of Documentation
- **Controlling communications**: Texts/emails showing regulation of daily activities
- **Financial records**: Showing economic control
- **Witness statements**: From people who observed the pattern
- **Medical records**: Showing health impacts, prevented care
- **Employment records**: Showing interference with work
- **Children's statements**: Age-appropriate disclosures about household rules and fears
- **Police reports**: Even if no arrest, showing pattern of calls
- **Protection order history**: Previous orders or violations
- **Social service involvement**: CPS reports, even if unfounded
- **Therapy records**: Documenting impact (with appropriate releases)

### Pattern Documentation
- **Timeline**: Showing escalation over time
- **Multiple forms**: Demonstrating various control tactics
- **Post-separation behavior**: Showing continuation of pattern
- **Impact evidence**: Demonstrating harm to victim and children
- **Context**: Explaining victim's responses as reasonable reactions to coercive control

## Coercive Control vs. Conflict

## Resources and Research
- Research by Evan Stark, Jane Monckton Smith, and others shows coercive control is:
  - The most common context for domestic violence homicide
  - More harmful to victims than discrete violent incidents
  - Particularly damaging to children's development
  - Often invisible to those not trained to recognize it

- Jurisdictions that criminalize coercive control recognize its serious harm

- Understanding coercive control is essential to protecting victims and children in family court

## Key Takeaways for Courts
- Coercive control is about power and domination, not conflict
- It creates psychological captivity and is extremely dangerous
- It continues and often escalates post-separation
- Courts can inadvertently facilitate continued abuse without training
- Pattern analysis is essential—individual incidents miss the bigger picture
- Children are harmed by coercive control even without direct violence
- Victim's trauma responses are evidence of abuse, not instability
- Equal treatment of parties ignores fundamental power imbalance created by abuse
