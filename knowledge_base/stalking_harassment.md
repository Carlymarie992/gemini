# Stalking and Harassment: Comprehensive Training Guide

## Definition
Stalking is a pattern of repeated, unwanted attention and contact that causes fear or concern for one's safety or the safety of someone close to the victim. Harassment is a course of conduct directed at a specific person that causes substantial emotional distress. Both are tools of coercive control.

## Key Patterns and Tactics

### 1. Physical Stalking
- **Following or surveillance**: Tracking victim's movements, showing up at locations
- **Showing up uninvited**: Appearing at home, workplace, children's school, or social events
- **Monitoring through others**: Using friends, family, or acquaintances to track victim
- **Installing tracking devices**: GPS trackers on vehicles, phones, or belongings
- **Parking or driving by**: Repeatedly driving past home or workplace
- **Trespassing**: Entering property without permission
- **Lurking**: Standing outside victim's home, workplace, or frequented locations

### 2. Digital Stalking (Cyberstalking)
- **Monitoring online activity**: Checking social media, email, browsing history
- **Spyware and monitoring apps**: Installing software to track phone/computer use

- **Unwanted gifts or letters**: Sending items or messages to maintain contact
- **Third-party contact**: Using others to relay messages or gather information
- **Silent calls**: Calling repeatedly and hanging up
- **Leaving voicemails**: Repeated messages, some threatening, some loving
- **Sending pictures or videos**: Often to intimidate or remind victim of their presence
- **Using multiple phone numbers**: To circumvent blocking

### 4. Harassment Through Legal System
- **Filing false police reports**: Making allegations to harass victim
- **Frivolous lawsuits**: Repeated litigation with no legitimate basis
- **False protective order requests**: Filing for orders to gain strategic advantage
- **Weaponizing child protective services**: Making false abuse reports
- **Subpoenaing friends/family**: Using discovery to harass victim's support system
- **Forcing repeated court appearances**: Filing motions to ensure continued contact

### 5. Indirect Harassment
- **Threatening through intermediaries**: Using others to convey threats
- **Damaging property**: Vandalizing car, home, belongings
- **Killing or harming pets**: Threatening or hurting animals to terrorize victim
- **Threatening loved ones**: Directing threats at children, family, friends
- **Workplace harassment**: Contacting employer, co-workers to damage reputation
- **Spreading rumors**: Telling lies to damage victim's reputation or relationships

## Escalation Patterns

### Warning Signs of Escalation
1. **Increasing frequency**: Contacts become more frequent over time
2. **Increasing intensity**: Behavior becomes more aggressive or threatening
3. **Boundary violations**: More brazen trespassing or rule-breaking
4. **Threatening language**: Moving from implicit to explicit threats
5. **Violence toward objects**: Breaking things, punching walls (precursor to physical violence)
6. **Suicidal threats**: Threats of self-harm to manipulate victim
7. **Stalking after separation**: Behavior intensifies when victim tries to leave

### Most Dangerous Period
- The most dangerous time for stalking victims is when they attempt to leave or have recently left the relationship
- Risk of violence, including homicide, increases significantly during this period
- Post-separation stalking is a strong predictor of serious violence

## Impact on Victims

### Psychological Effects
- Constant fear and hypervigilance
- Anxiety, depression, PTSD
- Loss of sense of safety and security
- Sleep disturbances and nightmares
- Difficulty concentrating or making decisions
- Feeling trapped or helpless

### Practical Impacts
- Job loss or career damage
- Financial losses (security measures, moving costs, legal fees)
- Social isolation (avoiding places, limiting activities)
- Relocation (sometimes multiple times)
- Lifestyle restrictions
- Inability to co-parent safely

### Impact on Children
- Witnessing parent's fear and distress
- Being used as tools for stalking (during custody exchanges)
- Learning unhealthy relationship patterns
- Disruption of stability and routines
- Potential targets themselves

## Recognition in Legal/Court Settings

### Red Flags Judges Should Recognize
1. **Pattern of contact despite court orders**: Repeated violations of no-contact provisions
2. **Abuse of legal system for contact**: Excessive motions, filings, communications through lawyers
3. **Tracking behavior**: Evidence of knowing victim's schedule, locations, activities
4. **Use of children for surveillance**: Excessive questioning of children about other parent
5. **Technology abuse**: Evidence of unauthorized account access, tracking devices
6. **Escalating behavior**: Increasing frequency or intensity of contact/harassment
7. **Minimizing or justifying**: Abuser claims behavior is normal, justified, or victim's fault

### Documentation That May Indicate Stalking/Harassment
- Phone records showing excessive calls/texts
- Screenshots of social media harassment
- Security camera footage
- Photos of abuser at victim's locations
- Witness statements from neighbors, co-workers, friends
- Police reports (though victim may not report due to fear)
- Records of protection order violations
- Evidence of tracking devices or spyware
- Gift receipts, delivery records

## How to Articulate Stalking and Harassment to Judges

### Framework for Explanation
1. **Define the pattern**: "Stalking is not isolated incidents—it's a pattern of behavior designed to instill fear and maintain control"

2. **Show the pervasiveness**: "This isn't about wanting to communicate. It's about refusing to accept the victim's autonomy and right to disengage"

3. **Explain the impact**: "The cumulative effect of these behaviors is to make the victim feel constantly watched, never safe, unable to move on with their life"

4. **Connect to power and control**: "Stalking and harassment are about ensuring the victim remains under the abuser's influence even after the relationship has ended"

5. **Highlight the danger**: "Research shows that stalking, especially post-separation stalking, is a significant predictor of serious violence including homicide"

### Effective Language for Court
- "Pattern of surveillance and unwanted contact designed to maintain power and control"
- "Systematic violation of victim's boundaries and autonomy"
- "Use of technology and legal system to extend abuser's reach"
- "Course of conduct that has created a reasonable fear for safety"
- "Continued attempts to monitor, control, and intimidate the victim"
- "These aren't isolated incidents—they're part of a deliberate pattern of harassment"

## Intersection with Other Forms of Abuse
- Often escalates after victim leaves or tries to establish independence
- Used in combination with economic abuse to prevent victim from working
- Frequently continues through family court proceedings
- May involve threatening children to maintain control
- Technology abuse enables both stalking and financial monitoring

## Legal Considerations

### Stalking as a Crime
- Felony in most jurisdictions
- May include cyberstalking provisions
- Can be basis for protective orders
- May affect custody and visitation decisions
- Violations of protective orders are separate offenses

### Challenges in Prosecution
- Difficult to prove without clear pattern
- Technology abuse may be hard to detect
- Victims often don't report due to fear or past negative experiences
- May be minimized as "he just wants to see his kids" in family court
- Cultural beliefs may normalize some stalking behaviors

## Special Considerations for Family Court

### Stalking in Context of Custody
- Abuser may use custody exchanges for stalking
- May seek shared custody to maintain access and control
- May weaponize children by questioning them about other parent
- Court-ordered communication (co-parenting apps) may be abused
- May violate boundaries while claiming to act in children's interests

### Protective Measures Courts Can Order
- Supervised exchanges at neutral locations
- Communication only through third party or monitored app
- Restrictions on questioning children about other parent
- Specific drop-off/pick-up protocols
- Prohibition on coming within certain distance of victim's home/work
- Restrictions on social media contact or references

## Risk Assessment
Judges should be aware of validated risk assessment tools for stalking:
- MOSAIC Threat Assessment
- Spousal Assault Risk Assessment (SARA)
- Danger Assessment (DA)

High-risk indicators include:
- History of violence
- Threats to kill
- Access to weapons
- Stalking after separation
- Violating protective orders
- Substance abuse
- Prior criminal history
- Escalating behavior

## Resources for Understanding
- Stalking is about power, control, and refusal to accept victim's autonomy
- Impact is cumulative—each incident adds to victim's fear
- Post-separation stalking is extremely dangerous
- Technology has given stalkers new tools and greater access
- Courts must take stalking seriously to prevent escalation to violence
