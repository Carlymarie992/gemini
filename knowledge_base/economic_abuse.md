# Economic Abuse: Comprehensive Training Guide

## Definition
Economic abuse (also called financial abuse) is a form of domestic abuse where one person controls another's ability to acquire, use, and maintain economic resources. It is a powerful tool for establishing and maintaining power and control in relationships.

## Key Patterns and Tactics

### 1. Control of Financial Resources
- **Restricting access to bank accounts**: Victim is denied access to joint or personal accounts
- **Confiscating paychecks**: Taking partner's earnings immediately upon receipt
- **Limiting knowledge of finances**: Hiding financial information, refusing to share details about income or assets
- **Preventing access to cash**: Not allowing partner to have money for basic needs
- **Controlling all financial decisions**: Making all purchases and financial choices unilaterally

### 2. Sabotaging Employment and Economic Opportunities
- **Preventing employment**: Forbidding partner from working or looking for work
- **Interfering with work**: Calling constantly, showing up at workplace, causing scenes
- **Sabotaging job opportunities**: Hiding car keys on interview days, turning off alarms
- **Forcing job loss**: Creating situations that lead to termination
- **Refusing to work**: Expecting partner to support household while refusing employment
- **Education interference**: Preventing partner from attending school or training

### 3. Exploiting Financial Resources
- **Running up debt in victim's name**: Opening credit cards, taking loans using partner's identity
- **Destroying credit**: Defaulting on shared accounts, refusing to pay bills
- **Stealing money or property**: Taking funds from accounts, selling belongings
- **Forcing financial responsibility**: Making victim solely responsible for all debts and bills
- **Using children as leverage**: Refusing to pay child support, demanding money for access to children

### 4. Legal and Systemic Economic Abuse
- **Litigation abuse**: Filing frivolous lawsuits to drain resources
- **Manipulating child support/alimony**: Hiding income, quitting jobs to avoid payments
- **Asset hiding**: Transferring assets to friends, family, or shell companies
- **False financial claims in court**: Lying about income, assets, or expenses
- **Forcing costly legal battles**: Continuously changing lawyers, filing motions, appealing decisions

## Impact on Victims

### Immediate Effects
- Inability to leave abusive situation due to lack of resources
- Dependency on abuser for survival needs
- Inability to afford legal representation
- Loss of housing security
- Food insecurity

### Long-term Consequences
- Damaged credit scores (can last 7-10 years)
- Difficulty obtaining housing, employment, loans
- Poverty and financial instability
- Inability to provide for children
- Psychological trauma (anxiety, depression, PTSD)
- Erosion of self-confidence and independence

## Recognition in Legal/Court Settings

### Red Flags Judges Should Recognize
1. **Disparate access to resources**: One party has expensive legal representation while the other is pro se or has limited counsel
2. **Pattern of litigation**: Repeated filings, appeals, motions that seem designed to drain resources
3. **Sudden unemployment**: Abuser becomes "unemployed" or takes lower-paying job when support is calculated
4. **Hidden income**: Evidence of lifestyle inconsistent with reported income
5. **Asset dissipation**: Sudden spending sprees, transfers, or "losses" of assets during divorce proceedings
6. **Coercive financial agreements**: Pressure to sign unfavorable agreements under duress

### Documentation That May Indicate Economic Abuse
- Bank account statements showing unilateral control
- Evidence of hidden accounts or assets
- Credit reports showing unauthorized debts
- Employment records showing interference
- Communication logs showing financial coercion
- Records of legal fees showing disparity in resources
- Evidence of asset transfers or hiding

## How to Articulate Economic Abuse to Judges

### Framework for Explanation
1. **Define the pattern**: "Economic abuse is a form of coercive control where one party uses financial means to dominate and control the other"

2. **Show the systematic nature**: "This isn't about disagreements over money. It's a pattern of behaviors designed to create dependency and prevent independence"

3. **Connect to current situation**: "The financial disparity we see in this courtroom is not accidental—it's the result of years of economic control that continues through this litigation"

4. **Highlight power imbalance**: "When one party controls all economic resources, the other cannot effectively participate in their own legal defense or post-separation independence"

5. **Explain long-term impact**: "Economic abuse doesn't end with separation—it often intensifies through litigation abuse and manipulation of support obligations"

### Effective Language for Court
- "Pattern of financial control that has continued throughout the relationship and into this litigation"
- "Systematic deprivation of economic resources necessary for independence"
- "Manipulation of legal and financial systems to maintain power and control"
- "Exploitation of economic disparity to prevent effective legal representation"
- "Continued coercive control through financial means post-separation"

## Intersection with Other Forms of Abuse
- Often accompanies physical and emotional abuse
- Used to prevent victim from leaving or seeking help
- Continues and escalates after separation
- Used in conjunction with legal abuse in family courts
- Amplifies impact of other controlling behaviors

## Legal Considerations
- May constitute grounds for protection orders in some jurisdictions
- Relevant to spousal support/alimony determinations
- Important for equitable distribution of assets
- Can affect child custody if it impacts child welfare
- May be evidence of coercive control in jurisdictions that recognize it as a crime

## Resources for Understanding
- Understanding economic abuse helps recognize why victims stay, why they struggle to leave, and why post-separation abuse often continues through financial and legal means
- Economic abuse is about power and control, not money itself
- Judges need to understand that equal treatment of parties who have unequal resources due to abuse may perpetuate the abuse
