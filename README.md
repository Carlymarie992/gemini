# North Dakota Legal Assistant

This project is an AI-powered legal assistant specializing in North Dakota civil litigation. It leverages Google's Gemini models to analyze evidence, help draft legal documents, and articulate compelling narratives based on established legal principles.

## Our Mission

The legal system can be an overwhelming and often unjust maze, especially for those without resources. People's lives can be destroyed by processes they don't understand and information that is deliberately kept complex and inaccessible.

This project is an effort to fight back against that "unseen evil."

Our goal is to empower individuals by making complex legal information more accessible. By harnessing advanced AI, we aim to give people a tool to better understand their situation, organize their evidence, and prepare to advocate for themselves. This is a step toward leveling the playing field.
